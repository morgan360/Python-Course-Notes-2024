    "#### For Loop\n",

    "A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string). This is helpful for performing an action on each item in the sequence.\n",

    "```\n",
    "### While Loop\n",

    "A `while` loop in Python executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition is true. It's used when you need to perform an action multiple times, but the exact number of iterations is not known beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",

    "Dictionaries in Python are powerful data structures that store data in key-value pairs. Here's a detailed overview to help you revise the concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Dictionaries: Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable, and indexed. In Python, dictionaries are written with curly brackets `{}`, and they have keys and values.\n",
    "- **Create**: You create a dictionary by placing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs within curly braces. A colon `:` separates each key from its associated value.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_dict = {\n",
    "      \"brand\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "      \"model\": \"Mustang\",\n",
    "      \"year\": 1964\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing Items**: You can access the value of a specific item by referring to its key name, enclosed in square brackets `[]`, or by using the `.get()` method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  x = my_dict[\"model\"]\n",
    "  # or\n",
    "  x = my_dict.get(\"model\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Changing Values**: You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_dict[\"year\"] = 2018\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adding Items**: Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_dict[\"color\"] = \"red\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removing Items**: There are several methods to remove items from a dictionary. The `pop()` method removes the item with the specified key name, `popitem()` method removes the last inserted item, and the `del` keyword removes the item with the specified key name or the entire dictionary when used without specifying a key.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  my_dict.pop(\"model\")\n",
    "  my_dict.popitem()\n",
    "  del my_dict[\"year\"]\n",
    "  # del my_dict would delete the whole dictionary\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Looping Through a Dictionary**: You can loop through a dictionary by using a `for` loop. When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for key in my_dict:\n",
    "      print(key)  # prints keys\n",
    "  \n",
    "  for key, value in my_dict.items():\n",
    "      print(key, value)  # prints keys and values\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionary Methods**: Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on dictionaries, including `.items()`, `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.clear()`, `.copy()`, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are ideal for storing data that can be uniquely identified by a key, like database records, configurations, and more. They offer fast lookups and can be nested, meaning you can have dictionaries within dictionaries for complex data structures."

    "You are planning a trip around the world. You have a list of countries you want to visit, a limited number of days you can travel, and a daily budget. Your task is to write a Python program that helps you manage your trip's details and ensures you don't exceed your budget or travel days.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Setup:\n",
    "- Create a list named `countries` from an **input()** statment in a while loop, which loops until the user enters 'end'.\n",
    "- Create a variable `total_days` from an input asking for total number of days you plan to travel.\n",
    "- Create a variable `daily_budget` from an input asking for daily spending budget in euros.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Travel Planning Function:\n",
    "- Write a function named `plan_trip` that accepts the list of countries, the total days, and the daily budget.\n",
    "- Inside the function, use a loop to print each country you plan to visit, using an f-string for formatting.\n",
    "- Calculate and return a tuple containing two elements: the total budget for the trip and the average budget per country. Assume you'll spend an equal number of days in each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Statements:\n",
    "- After calling the `plan_trip` function, use conditional statements to check if the total budget exceeds 2000 euros. If it does, print a warning message advising to save more money. Otherwise, congratulate the user on their upcoming adventure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enhanced Trip Details:\n",
    "- Modify the `plan_trip` function to also accept a list of must-visit places or landmarks for each country (use a list of lists or a dictionary). Incorporate this information into the loop that prints each country, displaying the places or landmarks alongside. You will need to create a separate list for places to visit for each country. So that means either you create a second loop to collect the information on places to visit. **Or**, a loop within a loop to collect the places just after each country is input.  Use a dictionary with 'key' as country and 'value' as list of places to visit :\n",
    "\n",

    "    \"Canada\": [\"Niagara Falls\", \"CN Tower\"],\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints:\n",

    "- You can use a break statement to end a loop\n",

    "```python\n",
    "if country.lower() == 'end':\n",
