    "\n",

    "A **value** is a piece of data you put in a variable. To go back to warehouse analogy, different boxes can store different values. For example, you can use one to store money for ongoing expenditures, and another one to save up for a specific occasion, like going on a trip. You can also empty the boxes or change their content, like adding money to boxes or taking some out.\n",

    "To know what each box is for, you need to label them.  With programming, it's the same: you assign a **name** to your variable:\n",

    "2. **Creating a variable**  \n",
    "You must create a variable in code if you are going to use one. Python is completely **object-oriented,** meaning that every variable is an **object**. Rather than declaring variables to reserve memory space, they are declared automatically when you assign a value to a variable.\n",
